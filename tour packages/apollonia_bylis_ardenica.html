        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Departing from Tirana at 09:00, we‚Äôll reach the Archeological Park of Apollonia in less than 1h 30 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Located 12km away from Fier city and also from the sea, Apollonia ruins are among the most visited archeological sites in Albania. Apollonia was founded near the Vjosa river 
            in 588 BC from greek colonies of Corfu and Corinth. The area was also inhabited by the Taulantii tribe, the local Illyrian tribe that for 
            centuries lived along with the Greek colonies. Apollonia was one of the 30 cities built in honor of Apollo goodness, the goodness of Sun,
             poetry, and music. Soon it became an important port full of life. The city became rich thanks to the commercial activities and the port that 
             could anchor about 100 ships. It grew prosperous until an earthquake destroyed almost all the buildings, thus slowly giving way to abandonment. Today, the ancient archeological site of Apollonia 
             is one of the best-known sites in Albania. It is now an important destination for cultural tourism in the country, 
             able to attract more and more visitors every year, and a potential recourse to improve the local economy.</p>
             <br>
